# Spirograph
## A Node.js web application using Express Framework and EJS templating system


### Requirements

1. Node.js - using version 8.9.4 in this example.


### Tools

We'll be building a web application using the Express Web Framework and EJS Templating System


#### Why Express Framework?
1. Easy for me to learn
2. Works with many templating libraries
3. Lots of examples on the web

Features listed on the website


#### Why EJS Templates?

EJS stands for Embedded JavaScript.

1. Recommended by a friend
2. Easy for me to learn


### Listing of Examples

1. My First Web App - use the ```express``` command to generate the boilerplate code for a web application.
2. Small Example - Accepting a request and responding.
3. Returning HTML - update Small Example to return HTML instead of plain text.
4. Hello World - read in the form data from the user, and return it formatted as a greeting.
5. Reading Spirograph Inputs - Update the Hello World app with inputs for performing spirograph calculations.
6. Plotting Spirograph Output - Add a Plotly.js widget that plots spirograph calculation output on a graph.
7. Add Input Validation - Numbers work ok in the app, but what happens when ```n1 = 'a'``` ?
8. Make it AJAXy - Avoid full page refreshes by using AJAX to update only the output plot.
9. Did someone say sPYrograph? - Use a Python kernel for the spirograph calculation.
